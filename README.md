This project is a beautifully designed web-based calculator that helps users perform linear regression analysis with ease. It allows input of paired data (X and Y values), and then calculates the regression line, showing the slope, intercept, and detailed steps involved in the process.

#Features

- Modern and elegant user interface with animated gradients and smooth transitions.

- Inputs for X and Y values in two columns.

- Automatic calculation of slope (m), intercept (b), and regression equation.

- Step-by-step explanation to help understand the process.

- Fully responsive design that works well on desktop and mobile devices.


#Technologies Used

- HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling.

- JavaScript (to be added) for dynamic calculations.

- CSS variables and keyframe animations for enhanced aesthetics.


#How to Use

1. Open the HTML file in your browser.


2. Enter X and Y values into the respective fields.


3. Click the "Calculate" button to generate the regression line.


4. Scroll down to see the equation, detailed steps, and result table.
